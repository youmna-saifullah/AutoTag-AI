        "# Problem Statement\n",
        "Customer support teams often struggle with high volumes of incoming tickets. Manually reading and assigning categories is slow, prone to human error, and delays resolution times. There is a need for an automated system that can accurately categorize free-text tickets into predefined labels with high confidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Objective\n",
        "To build an AI-driven system that uses Large Language Models to automatically classify support tickets. The system will leverage Prompt Engineering (Zero-shot and Few-shot) and potentially Fine-tuning to predict the top 3 most likely categories for any given ticket, improving organizational efficiency."
